# Breakout Tutorial wasm build

From https://github.com/TanTanDev/breakout_tutorial

This one inclues:

- [x] Ball appears after game starts instead of before after win/lose.

- [x] Less chance of getting dupe power up blocks because it compares to last number.

- [ ] Still some chance of the 3rd roll to be a dupe since no 3rd roll to 1st roll comparison.

- [ ] Swapped background colour with block colour as it glitches sometimes.
